              Fast forward to 2013. I had just finished high-school and felt the
              need to explore the world. I wanted to do something unique, only
              for the opportunity to volunteer in Rwanda presented itself.

              In Rwanda, I taught English at a local orphanage and a nearby
              preschool, needless to say, it was an enriching, but eye-opening
              experience. It changed me in more ways than I ever imagined. I of
              course, then had the urge to go back to Africa three years later
              for more volunteer work, this time to Kenya, I taught Maths and
              Physics at a high school in Kibera - the largest slum in Africa. I
              also worked as a healthcare assistant deeper in the slum to help
              local doctors treat the residents for Malaria and various
              respiratory infections.

              After my experiences in Africa, I developed an interest in
              Healthcare and emerging Biotechnology, which led me to major in
              Biochemistry in Dunedin, New Zealand.

              During my degree, Genetic Engineering and Bioinformatics played a
              big part in the course content, along with the treatment of
              cancer. We breifly played around with R and Python scripting,
              which was my first introduction to programming, which I took an
              interest in. The only complicating factor? At the end of my
              degree, I had an opportunity to do an intro flight at a local
              flight club, where I found a passion for Aviation...

              As a kid, flying was always one of those deep-seeded passions that
              I never really expected I'd pursue, but the combination of the
              intro flight in 2018, and a shortage of pilots, triggered an
              interest in giving it a go. I enrolled in a full-time course in
              2019 to chase the path of being a pilot.

              Once I got my private license (PPL), Covid-19 hit the world. This
              global event and it's inevitable impact on the Aviation industry
              forced me to step back and reconsider this path.

              During lockdown, I wanted to be as productive as possible, and
              fell back on honing in on my interest in Programming that sparked
              while doing Bioinformatics. I tried to learn as much web
              development technologies as possible, which continued to become
              more and more interesting the better I got. Once lockdown ended, I
              managed to secure myself three part-time jobs as a Bioinformatics
              Research Assistant. These jobs allowed me to dive into more
              practical programming, while continuing to progress through the
              online courses, and slowly updated my GitHub profile with small
              projects.
              <br />
              <br />
              I decided some formal programming training would benefit me moving
              forward, so I enrolled in the Postgraduate Certificate in
              Information Technology (PGCertIT) at Auckland University, which
              was a condensed period of both theory, and hands-on experience in
              Web Development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL)
              and Object Oriented Programming in Java. In this course, I
              achieved two 'Certificate of Outstanding Achievement' awards, and
              qualified for the Masters of Information Technology (MInfoTech),
              where I specialised in Software Development and Health
              Informatics.
              <br />
              <br />
              Through this, I managed to get multiple offers from companies for
              a summer internship and I ended up accepting one at Xero. I worked
              hard enough to ask to stay on as a Graduate Engineer, which was
              approved!
              <br />
              From the Graduate program at Xero I eventually got promoted to
              Associate Engineer, and a year later got promoted to an
              Intermediate Full-Stack Engineer and have continued to enjoy
              learning how to become the best Engineer I can be, in both
              technical and non-technical skills.
