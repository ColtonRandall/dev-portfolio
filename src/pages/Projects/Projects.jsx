              The website you're currently on began as my first personal
              project, as a canvas for my early IT courses back in 2021.
              <br />
              <br />
              Itâ€™s evolved from basic HTML and CSS into a React app using
              Material UI and other libraries, and is fully responsive for
              smaller screens ðŸ“±.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can check out the codebase for the original version of this
              site{" "}

              <br />I now use this site to showcase my projects, blog posts, and
              other milestones.
