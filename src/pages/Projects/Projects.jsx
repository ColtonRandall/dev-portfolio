              This is a weather application that aims to mock an API for weather
              based on cities around the world.
              <br />
              <br />
              The structure of this project is based on the Spring Boot

              <br />
              <br />
              There will be a User interface in the console that will allow a
              client/user to enter a city and receive weather information (in
              JSON) about that particular city.

              The website you're currently on began as my first personal

              Itâ€™s evolved from basic HTML and CSS into a React app using
              Material UI and other libraries, and is fully responsive for
              smaller screens ðŸ“±.
