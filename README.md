# Colton's Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Dev Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

> View the live site [here](https://coltonrandall.github.io/dev-portfolio/).

While here, you'll get a better sense of my background (both personally and professionally), the credentials/training I've recieved, and see the projects I've created ðŸ”¨ .

This is also my space for consolidating modern web-development knowledge in varying frameworks and languages, while also acting as a canvas for experimenting with new concepts.

### Tech Stack

Currently, this website is built using a combination of React and the [Material UI library](https://mui.com). It's an updated version of my initial site I created years ago when I began experimenting with HTMl, CSS and JavaScript ([see here](https://github.com/ColtonRandall/old-portfolio-website)).

âœ¶ **This site is also responsive** - so see how it responds to different window sizes, or view the url on your tablet / phone! ðŸ“± <https://coltonrandall.github.io/dev-portfolio/>

This portfolio is continually being updated as I progress through my career.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out.
