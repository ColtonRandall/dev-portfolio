Welcome to my personal developer portfolio. This is a space where you can learn more about my professional background, training, and explore the projects I’ve built 🔨.

This site also serves as my development sandbox, where I consolidate modern web knowledge across frameworks and languages, while experimenting with new tools, techniques, and UI patterns.

### 🚧 Work in Progress

This site evolves alongside my career, both in content and code. More projects, UI refinements, and interactive features will be added over time.
