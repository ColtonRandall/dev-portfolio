While here, you'll get a better sense of my background (both personally and professionally), the credentials/training I've recieved, and see the projects I've created ðŸ”¨ .

This is also my space for consolidating modern web-development knowledge in varying frameworks and languages, while also acting as a canvas for experimenting with new concepts.

### Tech Stack

Currently, this website is built using a combination of React and the [Material UI library](https://mui.com). It's an updated version of the initial, static site I created years ago when I began experimenting with HTMl, CSS and JavaScript ([see here](https://github.com/ColtonRandall/old-portfolio-website)).

Build and deployments were done exclusively using GitHub actions and is hosted on GitHub pages :octocat: 

âœ¶ **This site is also responsive** - so see how it responds to different window sizes, or view the url on your tablet / phone.

This portfolio is continually being updated as I progress through my career.

#### Commands run every time I add changes

1. `npm run dev` - Runs the application locally
2. `npm run build` - builds and compiles prior to committing changes and pushing up to GitHub
3. `npm run deploy` - deploy/publish to lives github pages website https://coltonrandall.com
